    # Abstract
    On the surface, React may look like just a view library, but there is big ecosystem that revolves around it. This workshop starts with understanding the basic internals of React before exploring how to “think in React”, best practices and solutions to real problems that you will experience while building an application.

    Learn React the right way from the industry experts.

    # Who is this workshop for?

    This workshop is for developers who have an understanding of javascript, looking to get started with React or moving from a different framework like angular, ember, etc.

    # Requirements

    Bring your laptop with node (>=6) and npm (>=4) installed and an open mind :)

    # Duration: 6 Hours

    # Outline:


    #### Stage 1
    Technically, it’s possible to write a React app without the latest version of JavaScript, but it won’t be easy. We’ll learn the good parts that make it easier to write maintainable code with React. Let’s also find the reason behind React’s popularity, what makes it so good?

    - ES6
    - Fundamental concepts of React
    - Virtual DOM

    #### Stage 2
    Learning the methods of React is important, but useless without learning how to “think in React”. Let’s understand the patterns that make your components extremely reusable and your application more declarative.

    - Thinking in React
    - Stateless components + JSX
    - Props
    - State 
    - Stateful components
    - Lifecycle methods

    #### Stage 3
    Next we introduce you to routing, and explain how you can use React Router to add links to additional pages in your app.
    
    - React router

    #### Stage 4
    Let’s take things to the next level and explore how to build real world applications that handle state and deal with data. If you have heard of state management libraries like redux  you’ll learn how and more importantly when to use them to get the maximum benefit.

    - Making a API call
    - State management
    - Redux Dev Tools
