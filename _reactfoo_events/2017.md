    Every major website in India and beyond is shifting to React. As a result, there is a thriving React ecosystem that more and more people are trying to get into. Due to overwhelming attention that React commands today, we've launched a new single-day conference distinct from [JSFoo](https://jsfoo.in) - our annual JavaScript conference.
  right_content: |
    The target audience for this yearâ€™s edition includes React practitioners and developers keen to understand optimizing. We will have topics ranging from Redux and state management, Routing, React Native, styling, Decorators, React testing, alternative frameworks, and more.
