    ## Abstract

    The Workshop focuses on how to build native iOS and android app using React Native such that it can easily be extended to any platform such as Windows Phone, Web, Desktop, Electron and even VR*.  

    In short, the workshop will focus on how to write/structure your React Native apps such that they share 80% of the source code (all the Business logic) across all platforms and only rewrite the view or layout layer (rest 20%) differently for different platforms. We will do live setup of a single platform (iOS) React Native app and we will be adding each platform step by step extending out app to multiple platforms. The talk will introduce code conventions and tools that can accelerate  development with React Native.

    Thus allowing teams to:
    - Launch across multiple platforms faster by reducing the development time exponentially.
    - Extend to any new platform (mixed reality .. who knows?) that arrives in future.
    - Do minimal code duplication.
    - Reduce cost by having a single team managing all the platforms.
    - Faster bug fixes due to shared business logic code.

    The knowledge is based on the experience of working with React Native apps for around 1.5 years and helping clients launch their apps quicker than ever before.

    This talk is for: developers who have worked with React and are looking into jumping/ already working with React Native.

    This talk will help:
    - React developers who are planning to start with react-native applications.
    - react-native developers extend their codebase to support other platforms by just following some code conventions

    ##  Prerequisites

    - Yarn: npm install -g yarn
    - An ESLint supported IDE, preferably Atom: https://atom.io
    - Clone this repo: https://github.com/react-native-workshop/note-taker

    Note: Android SDK setup is a mandate for linux/windows users. Please install the android sdk by following steps in the README file of out repo.⁠⁠

    ## Date and Time
