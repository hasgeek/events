    After successful editions in Bangalore and Pune, ReactFoo travels to other cities like Hyderabad, Mumbai and Delhi. The Delhi edition will focus on the following topics:
    
    1. Success and failure stories of implementing React and React Native for your use-case.
    2. Your experiences with alternatives to React – such as Angular, Vue and other frameworks – why these worked / did not work for your use-case. 
    3. Front-end architecture patterns and approaches with React.
    4. Mobile engineering with React Native or alternatives. 


    **ReactFoo Delhi is an event for JavaScript and front-end engineers, cross-platform developers.**

    Hands-on workshops for 30-40 participants will be held on next day of the conference. Workshops will be announced shortly. **Tickets have to be purchased separately.**
