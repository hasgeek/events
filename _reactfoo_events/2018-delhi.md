    After successful editions in Bangalore, Pune, Hyderabad and Mumbai, ReactFoo travels to Delhi. The Delhi edition will focus on the following topics:

    1. Performance and React.
    2. Performance, in general.
    3. Architecture with React.
    4. Alternatives to React – such as Angular, Vue and other frameworks – why these worked / did not work for your use-case.
    5. Mobile engineering with ReactNative or alternatives.


    **ReactFoo Delhi is an event for JavaScript, React and front-end engineers.**
