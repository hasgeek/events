    After a successful first edition in Bangalore, ReactFoo travels to Pune. ReactFoo Pune will focus on the following topics:

    1. Success and failure stories of implementing React and React Native for your use-case.
    2. Lessons learned in shifting codebase from older frameworks to React.
    3. Comparative advantages of React and other JS frameworks.
    4. Comparative advantages of React Native in working on mobile applications.
    5. Security concerns.

    **ReactFoo Pune is an event for practitioners, by practitioners.**

    We invite developers and architects from large and small organizations to share their stories and insights with the community.

    * Single track of talks and Birds of Feather (BOF) sessions on 19 January.
    * Hands-on workshops on 20 January.
