    #### Confirmed talks and schedule:
    Below is a list of the first set of confirmed talks for security and DevOps track at Rootconf 2019:
    
    1. Securing infrastructure starts from your home. Or so indicates [Abhay Rana (Nemo) as he talks about his experiments with running a home server and recommends why you should run one too.](https://hasgeek.com/rootconf/2019/proposals/learnings-from-running-my-home-server-and-why-you-ctdadStRfnu2gAn2xQWNfS)
    2. If giving SSH access to developers was not a pain point, how do you scale access in large organizations? [Pulkit Vaishnav suggests that SSH certificate-based authentication provides an alternative for scaling SSH access.](https://hasgeek.com/rootconf/2019/proposals/ssh-certificates-a-way-to-scale-ssh-access-WDAL3yH2bH3HyzW4aEFckY)
    3. Are you aware that your organization could be leaving digital trails of its infrastructure on the internet? Hackers refer to this publicly available information as Open Source INTelligence(OSINT). [Bharath, a security engineer at Appsecco, explains how to create a pipeline for gathering and storing OSINT data, visualize this data, and how to create monitoring systems for tracking this data.](https://hasgeek.com/rootconf/2019/proposals/from-data-to-decisions-leveraging-osint-data-to-ta-3xF8pcn5PYqehE5Y9JLEQF)
    4. Data exfiltration attacks like Magecart have allowed attackers to steal millions of users’ credit card data. Existing security systems fail to prevent or even detect these attacks. This is a major blind-spot in the security monitoring systems. [Lavakumar Kuppan explains how DevOps engineers can leverage Content Security Policy (CSP) – a standard supported in most modern browsers – to increase protection against Magecart type attacks.](https://hasgeek.com/rootconf/2019/proposals/deploying-and-managing-csp-the-browser-side-firewa-DGam5vKqX5iPVUG2z9YSw7)
    5. Python is used in many environments where security is critical. Validating dependencies of such projects is also important along with the actual project source code. Or else, the vulnerabilities in these dependencies will have cascading effects for users. Therefore, how do you build reproducible Python applications for secured environments? [Using a case study, Kushal Das will demonstrate this talk live, at Rootconf 2019.](https://hasgeek.com/rootconf/2019/proposals/building-reproducible-python-applications-for-secu-cyprfnoPePmii2SjQHCEkB)
    6. Open standards versus managed infrastructure – are we trading freedom for convenience? In this keynote talk, [Bernd Erk argues that open standards go beyond the boundaries of development and operation. They are the foundation for barrier-free interoperability and independent communications. This is why we must preserve open standards.](https://hasgeek.com/rootconf/2019/proposals/how-convenience-is-killing-open-standards-rW23MHu8VaVkgiekhAdKJj)
    7. How do you productionize Kafka streams at a scale as large as Walmart? [Deepak Goyal explains in this experiential talk.](https://hasgeek.com/rootconf/2019/proposals/kafka-streams-at-scale-yik2Kzo4vx3zDeQqnX3F3n)
    8. Shakthi Kannan, senior DevOps engineer at Aerospike, will talk about [the implementation of, and learnings from, a Wireshark Lua plugin to solve issues at the wire level, and how you can do it too.](https://hasgeek.com/rootconf/2019/proposals/shooting-the-trouble-down-to-the-wireshark-lua-plu-78tKrEaA8wCRiiQorcgtWd)
    
    BOF sessions on DevSecOps, testing infrastructure code building remote teams and others will be held in parallel to the main conference sessions, post-lunch.
