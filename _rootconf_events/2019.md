overview:
  left_content: |
     Rootconf 2019 looks at the broader theme of costs of the choices we make for infrastructure. Infrastructure is closely tied to the business and product context. Therefore, what are the trade-offs we make for the product, reliability and availability, and customer empathy with each choice? Costs are more than money; they include human rosource reallocation, resources for running infra, and gains/losses in product traction and usage. Let's discuss this as a community, in 2019.
