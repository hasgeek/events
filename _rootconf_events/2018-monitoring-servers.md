    # Abstract
    This workshop aims to help attendees in getting familiar with monitoring tools so that the focus can be extended to measuring application performance and business outcomes rather than just stock 
    concerns like disk, CPU and memory.

    In this workshop, we would be setting up tools to collect metrics and visualizing them, using dashboards. While making use of annotation and alerts, we will learn to detect, diagnose and resolve faults.

    # Target Audience

    - Beginners to Monitoring tools
    
    - Newbies to handling infrastructure
    
    - Fast growing Start-ups looking to make better use of their infrastructure
