    ### Introduction
    Security in the modern world is a complicated subject. It has many facets and is visible to people in myriad of ways. One of the biggest challenges anyone interested in security faces is how to get started and how is something relevant for their use case. To tackle this prickly problem, we are creating a physical space for undertaking a security journey. This journey is relevant for many different types of people with varying experience levels and expectations.
    As with any journey there is a starting point and many pit stops on the way. Based on your time, interest and availability you may want to stop at every pit stop or you may want to choose where to stop. Donâ€™t worry friendly faces will guide you along the way.
