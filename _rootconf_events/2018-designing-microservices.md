    # Abstract
    Microservices architecture is the new buzz word. While the key ideas like “modularity”, “separation of concerns”, “doing one thing well” etc. are well known guiding priciples from long time, the advent of containers and maturity in devops practices made it possible to build software applications as microservices.

    In this workshop, participants get to know what it takes to design an application as microservices, while clearly undertanding the price they are paying and the the benefits they are receiving. During the workshop, the participants will be divided into groups of 4/5 people and each group will discuss and design a non-trivial application as microservices.

    # Who is this Workshop for?

    This workshop is primarily aimed at tech leads, software architects and CTOs. It’ll also be useful for experienced software developers who have keen interest in microservices.
