    # Abstract

    Ansible is software that automates software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment. Ansible is a radically simple IT automation platform that makes your applications and systems easier to deploy. Avoid writing scripts or custom code to deploy and update your applications— automate in a language that approaches plain English, using SSH, with no agents to install on remote systems.

    # Pre-Requisites

    - Basic Linux Administrator Skills
    - Open mind and spirit to learn.
    
    # Software Requirements
    
    We will be using two centos7 vagrant machines for the workshop. Make sure you are using a Linux distribution and have vagrant configured with any of the providers like libvirt, virtual box, etc.

    If you are unable to install vagrant on your Linux systems, then you might want to install Fedora operating system and come for the workshop, we can do the rest together.
