    On 23rd September, we’re putting together a Rootconf meetup at WalmartLabs. In this meetup, we hope to discuss and debate about server less architecture.  Serverless architectures refer to applications that significantly depend on third-party services (knows as Backend as a Service or "BaaS") or on custom code that's run in ephemeral containers (Function as a Service or "FaaS”).  It allows you to build and run applications and services without having to manage infrastructure.

    However, serverless also means serveral drawbacks including problems due to third-party API system, lack of operational tools, architectural complexity & implementation drawbacks. We'll have 2 talks followed by a panel discussion to delve deeper into the topic.

    If you'd like to get both the sides of server less architecture, this is a great place to be. RSVP now to reserve your spot!
    
    If you'd like to speak at the meetup or on the panel, write to shreyaskutty@hasgeek.com before Thursday, 21st September.
