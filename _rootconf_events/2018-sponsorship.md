    ### Rootconf is where systems and operations engineers share real world knowledge about building reliable systems.
    The conference will feature talks on state of the art deployment strategies and appropriate monitoring technologies at different scales. Rootconf 2018 will broadly cover topics like toil, on-call, outage handling, and post-mortem analysis. We are inviting presentation proposals from academics and practitioners on these topics.

    Rootconf aims to appeal to the widest possible range of DevOps practitioners: from embryonic startups to the largest established enterprises. We are keen to schedule presentations that appeal both to attendees’ current needs as well as their future aspirations.

    Talks from previous edition were broadly on:

    * Capacity planning and deployment strategies
    * Deploying and orchestration of container based infrastructures
    * Monitoring and automation
    * Postmortem/root-cause analysis
    * Outage handling and incident response

  blurb: "Between refreshing new lessons, business leads, potential hires and the sheer energy of thetalent present at the conference, I think it was money and time well spent, even for an early stage startup as ours. We sent 11 members of our team including interns, and I'd do it all over again without thinking twice! This is the standard of discourse we should try and maintain across any conference or event we organize, these guys at HasGeek have a thing or two to teach the rest of our tech ecosystem."
  designation: "Founder and CEO, Mad Street Den"
- name: "Dhatri Misra on droidconIN 2016"
  blurb: "Droidcon was a great experience, with so many developers to learn from and meet. Conferenceslike these give you so many perspectives to look at. The most awaited part for me at the Droidcon was the Women In Tech panel discussion. We need to get more women talking about the challenges they face and how they overcome it.The conference had the Child care facility. You need to be very sensitive to think of something that is so important to parents attending the conference."
