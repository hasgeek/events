    Cloud server management brings with it as many challenges as it offers conveniences. It is time to unbundle questions about:

    1. Resource allocation: manpower, time and money.
    2. Scaling: how best to utilize capacity in the present, and factors involved in planning for the future.
    3. Security: which scenarios must you plan for, and how best to secure your data, applications and systems?

    Each miniconf is a full day event consisting of:
