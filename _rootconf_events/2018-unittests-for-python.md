    # Abstract
    Are you new to unit testing? TDD looks like a buzz word? <br><br>
    Or do you feel like you know the syntax, but would like to understand new idioms and where to use them? <br><br>
    Want to watch an experienced TDD developer create code from nothing? <br><br>
    Instead of just covering the syntax, we will introduce most of UnitTests using nose as we build code together. <br><br>

    # Requirements

    - Basic knowledge of coding in Python is required, understanding web RestAPI is a plus. <br><br>
    - Please bring you own laptop with python 2.7 or above installed <br><br>
    - Detailed setup instructions will be emailed a week before the workshop day <br><br>
