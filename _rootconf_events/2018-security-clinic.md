    ### Introduction
    Security in the modern world is a complicated subject. It has many facets and is visible to people in myriad of ways. One of the biggest challenges anyone interested in security faces is how to get started and how is something relevant for their use case. To tackle this prickly problem, we are creating a physical space for undertaking a security journey. This journey is relevant for many different types of people with varying experience levels and expectations.
    As with any journey there is a starting point and many pit stops on the way. Based on your time, interest and availability you may want to stop at every pit stop or you may want to choose where to stop. Donâ€™t worry friendly faces will guide you along the way.

    ### Who should attend?
    You should attend if you're:
    - interested in security, but not sure how to start.
    - tasked with or responsible for security in your company and want to understand the landscape by interacting with people who do this daily for global clients.

    ### Pitstops
    At Appsecco we pride ourselves in being extremely pragmatic about explaining security and helping people understand the hard to understand industry lingo as well.
