  blurb: |
    Our story: from the garage to the Googleplex.

    The Google story begins in 1995 at Stanford University. Larry Page was considering
    Stanford for grad school and Sergey Brin, a student there, was assigned to show him
    around. By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first
    meeting, but by the following year they struck a partnership. Working from their dorm
    rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine the importance of
    individual pages on the World Wide Web. They called this search engine Backrub.
    Soon after, Backrub was renamed Google (phew). The name was a play on the
    mathematical expression for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros and aptly reflected
    Larry and Sergey&#39;s mission “to organize the world’s information and make it universally
    accessible and useful.”

    Over the next few years, Google caught the attention of not only the academic
    community, but Silicon Valley investors as well. In August 1998, Sun co-founder Andy
    Bechtolsheim wrote Larry and Sergey a check for $100,000, and Google Inc. was
    officially born. With this investment, the newly incorporated team made the upgrade
    from the dorms to their first office: a garage in suburban Menlo Park, California, owned
    by Susan Wojcicki (employee #16 and now CEO of YouTube). Clunky desktop
    computers, a ping pong table, and bright blue carpet set the scene for those early days
    and late nights. (The tradition of keeping things colorful continues to this day.)

    Even in the beginning, things were unconventional: from Google’s initial server (made of
    Lego) to the first “Doodle”in 1998: a stick figure in the logo announcing to site visitors
    that the entire staff was playing hooky at the Burning Man Festival. “Don&#39;t be evil” and
    “The ten things we know to be true” captured the spirit of our intentionally
    unconventional methods. In the years that followed, the company expanded rapidly —
    hiring engineers, building a sales team, and introducing the first company dog, Yoshka.
    Google outgrew the garage and eventually moved to its current headquarters (a.k.a.“The
    Googleplex”) in Mountain View, California. The spirit of doing things differently made
    the move. So did Yoshka.

    The relentless search for better answers continues to be at the core of everything we
    do. Today, with more than 60,000 employees in 50 different countries, Google makes
    hundreds of products used by billions of people across the globe, from YouTube and
    Android to Smartbox and, of course, Google Search. Although we’ve ditched the Lego
    servers and added just a few more company dogs, our passion for building technology
    for everyone has stayed with us — from the dorm room, to the garage, and to this very
    day.
