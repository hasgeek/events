  blurb: |
    Our story: from the garage to the Googleplex.

    The Google story begins in 1995 at Stanford University. Larry Page was considering
    Stanford for grad school and Sergey Brin, a student there, was assigned to show him
    around. By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first
    meeting, but by the following year they struck a partnership. Working from their dorm
    rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine the importance of
    individual pages on the World Wide Web. They called this search engine Backrub.
    Soon after, Backrub was renamed Google (phew). The name was a play on the
    mathematical expression for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros and aptly reflected
    Larry and Sergey&#39;s mission “to organize the world’s information and make it universally
    accessible and useful.”

    Over the next few years, Google caught the attention of not only the academic
    community, but Silicon Valley investors as well. In August 1998, Sun co-founder Andy
    Bechtolsheim wrote Larry and Sergey a check for $100,000, and Google Inc. was
    officially born. With this investment, the newly incorporated team made the upgrade
    from the dorms to their first office: a garage in suburban Menlo Park, California, owned
    by Susan Wojcicki (employee #16 and now CEO of YouTube). Clunky desktop
    computers, a ping pong table, and bright blue carpet set the scene for those early days
    and late nights. (The tradition of keeping things colorful continues to this day.)

    Even in the beginning, things were unconventional: from Google’s initial server (made of
    Lego) to the first “Doodle”in 1998: a stick figure in the logo announcing to site visitors
    that the entire staff was playing hooky at the Burning Man Festival. “Don&#39;t be evil” and
    “The ten things we know to be true” captured the spirit of our intentionally
    unconventional methods. In the years that followed, the company expanded rapidly —
    hiring engineers, building a sales team, and introducing the first company dog, Yoshka.
    Google outgrew the garage and eventually moved to its current headquarters (a.k.a.“The
    Googleplex”) in Mountain View, California. The spirit of doing things differently made
    the move. So did Yoshka.

    The relentless search for better answers continues to be at the core of everything we
    do. Today, with more than 60,000 employees in 50 different countries, Google makes
    hundreds of products used by billions of people across the globe, from YouTube and
    Android to Smartbox and, of course, Google Search. Although we’ve ditched the Lego
    servers and added just a few more company dogs, our passion for building technology
    for everyone has stayed with us — from the dorm room, to the garage, and to this very
    day.

    Delivering Cloud-like Simplicity for Application Networking to Enterprises

    Enterprises seek public-cloud- like agility. However, appliance-based load balancers can’t meet the needs of cloud-native applications in modern data centers. We built
    Avi Networks to match the application services needs of these dynamic environments that go well beyond load balancing. Avi eliminates overspending and
    over-provisioning and elevates load balancing by taking advantage of the strategic position of load balancers (in the path of application traffic) to deliver application insights that have never before been possible. The Avi Vantage
    Platform delivers elastic and programmable application services on standard x86 servers, VMs, or containers on-premises or in the cloud.

    “We immediately knew we had hit the ‘holy grail’ for app delivery.”

    We built the Avi Vantage Platform on software-defined principles to separate the control plane (for central management) from the data plane (of distributed load
    balancers). Global 2000 technology, media, and financial services companies use Avi Networks to deliver scalable application-centric services in SDN load
    balancing, OpenStack, VMware, container, bare metal, or public cloud environments. PS: Avi means “rising sun” in Sanskrit. By eliminating the final obstacles that
    customers face in dynamic data centers and clouds, we bring them to the dawn of accelerated service delivery.

  blurb: |
    The Tor network is a group of volunteer-operated servers that allows people to improve their privacy and security on the Internet.
    Tor's users employ this network by connecting through a series of virtual tunnels rather than making a direct connection, thus allowing
    both organizations and individuals to share information over public networks without compromising their privacy. Along the same line,
    Tor is an effective censorship circumvention tool, allowing its users to reach otherwise blocked destinations or content. Tor can also be
    used as a building block for software developers to create new communication tools with built-in privacy features.
    Ongoing trends in law, policy, and technology threaten anonymity as never before, undermining our ability to speak and read freely online.
    These trends also undermine national security and critical infrastructure by making communication among individuals, organisations,
    corporations, and governments more vulnerable to analysis. Each new Tor user and Tor relay provides additional diversity, enhancing
    Tor's ability to put control over your security and privacy back into your hands.

    Simpl is focused on transforming how the people of India deal with money. Its first product is a payment mode that lets users skip traditional forms of payments entirely. Instead, all the transactions get added into a single bill, payable on the 1st and 16th of every month. This way, the checkout process takes less than a few seconds - making it a win-win for merchants and users alike.
    
    In place of traditional forms of identification and authentication, Simpl integrates deeply into merchant apps via SDKs and APIs. This allows for more sophisticated forms of authentication that take full advantage of smartphone data and processing power.
    
    Simpl was founded in 2015 by Nityanand Sharma and Chaitra Chidanand, and went live in 2016.
