   #### About the 2019 edition of Anthill Inside:

    At the 2018 edition of Anthill Inside, a conversation that got most traction and interest was about the hubs and spokes of AI. At a Birds of Feather (BOF) session on the hubs and spokes of AI, we discussed:

    1. Data acquisition and health of data; incorporating label uncertainty while training models.
    2. Retraining models; detecting and handling concept drifts in the data.
    3. DevOps and best practices for model change management; monitoring model health
    4. Human intervention factors, including incorporating learnings from the feedback loop; pointers for moving in the direction of auto-pilot mode.
