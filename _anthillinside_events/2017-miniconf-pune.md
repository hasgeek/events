    Anthill Inside offers to bridge the gap between concepts and latest research in ML, DL and AI, with realities on the ground. The Pune edition covers four broad areas: 

    1. How to integrate analytics into the fabric of a company. 
    2. Introduction to some concepts in math, NLP and ML. 
    3. Real-life application of these concepts in molecular biology and advertising. 
    4. Evaluation of hardware, cloud and related infrastructure in training ML models and DL networks.  

    ### Target audience

    1.	Engineers who want to learn concepts in maths, ML and DL. 
    2.	Engineers who are building data pipelines and mining data in real-time.  
    3.	Architects and decision-makers who want to implement analytics in their companies. 
    4.	Masters and doctoral candidates who want to understand real-world developments and how concepts are being applied.
