overview:
  left_content: |
    When it comes to Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), three aspects are crucial:

    1. Clarity of fundamental concepts.
    2. Insights and nuances when applying concepts to solve real-world problems.
    3. Knowledge of tools for automating ML and DL.

    Anthill Inside Miniconf will provide understanding on each of these fronts.

    This miniconf is a full day event consisting of:

    * 3-4 talks each, on concepts, applications and tools.
    * Birds of Feather (BOF) sessions on focussed topics.

    ### Hands-on workshops:

    Hands-on workshops for 30-40 participants on 25 November will help in internalizing concepts, and practical aspects of working with tools. Workshop tickets have to be purchased separately. (Workshops will be announced shortly.)

    ### Who should attend? Why should you attend?

    1. ML engineers who want to learn about concepts in maths, stats and strengthen foundations.
    2. ML engineers wanting to learn from experiences and insights of others.
    3. Senior architects and decision-makers who want to quick run-through of concepts, implementation case studies, and overview of tools.
    4. Masters and doctoral candidates who want to bridge the gap between academia and practice.
