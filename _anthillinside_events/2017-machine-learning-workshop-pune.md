    Learn machine learning basics by solving problems and developing an ML application in Python. Attendees will learn about Python data ecosystem APIs (Numpy, Pandas and scikit-learn)  algorithms, implementation practices, maths, and other APIs/tools. This is a beginner level workshop. Basic programming skills are required.

    There are many ways to approach machine learning field. We can start with knowing the tools and the APIs and then gradually approach the underhood maths. Alternatively, we can start with maths and then APIs/tools can be learnt later. The workshop objective is to cover each aspect in some detail. The outline will be as follows,

      1. Introduction to Python data ecosystem: few hands on exercises on numpy and pandas to serve as warmup (~ 30 minutes)
      2. Introduction to machine learning: mostly plain English content, covering big picture (~ 30 minutes)
      3. Building a regression/classifier from scratch in Python (~ 45 - 50 minutes)
      4. Solving a more involved problem by using scikit-learn APIs directly (~ 30 minutes)
      5. Next steps, how to study and which resources can be used (~ 20 minutes)
      6. Summarizing what we learnt, question-answers (~ 10 minutes)

    Overall, the workshop would take 3 hours +- 15 minutes. Note that this is a beginner workshop and if you are already a practicing data scientist then most of the material will be too basic for you.

    ### Computing Requirements

      + Laptop (operating system of your choice), charged battery + charger.
      + Python installed on the laptop + IDE of your choice/termincal.
        + No hard choice between python 2 Vs python 3.
      + Following libraries __MUST__ be installed.
        - Numpy
        - Scipy
        - Pandas
        - scikit-learn
      + It won't be possible to provide installation support at the time of workshop. So all requirements should be pre-installed. Without the installations, you won't get anything out of the workshop.

    ### Maths Knowledge Requirements

    It would help if you brush up the following topics from high school. Although these are not mandatory, we will cover enough details at the time of workshop.

      + Basics of derivatives and concept of maxima-minima.
      + Basics of matrix and vector manipulation from linear algebra.

    ### Programming Knowledge Requirements

      + You should know basic programming
        + Reading and Writing files
        + Flow controls (if-else)
        + Looping constructs like for loop, while
        + Variable assignments
      + In other words, you should have programmed at least few hundred lines in any mainstream programming language.
      + The implementation choice for this workshop will be Python.
