    This workshop is a follow-up to the talk ["Decentralized AI" by Gene Kogan on December 12](https://anthillinside.in/2017-dec-bangalore-lecture/), which is about the intersection of artificial intelligence with decentralization technologies such as blockchains and smart contracts. Primary sub-topics include blockchain mechanics and cryptography, federated learning, and security considerations. Relevant platforms will be introduced. The tentative syllabus is as follows:

    #### cryptography prerequisites
    
    * public key cryptography
    * hashing and proof-of-work
    * smart contracts
    * TUTORIAL: digital signatures

    #### blockchains

    * how blockchains work
      * Bitcoin protocol
      * TUTORIAL: proof-of-work on simple blockchain
    * survey of cryptocurrencies
    * second-generation blockchain applications
      * Namecoins, colored coins, smart properties, tokens
      * distributed data, BigchainDB
    * deconstructing blockchains
      * blockchain as a state-transition system
      * Ethereum
    * decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO)

    #### machine learning

    * deep learning
      * applications to computer vision, natural language processing
      * TUTORIAL: basic image classifier in Keras
    * problems with centralized machine learning
      * data security and surveillance
      * problems with economic model
    * federated learning
    * security issues with federated learning
      * differential privacy
    * why are blockchains relevant to machine learning?

    #### blockchains + machine learning

    * federated learning on a blockchain
      * Openmined
    * AI + DAOs
    * impact of AI on decentralized applications
      * asset management + "sharing economy"
      * data markets and exchanges
      * mutual funds, insurance, co-ops
    * dangers of AI DAOs
    * Art DAOs
