    This workshop is a follow-up to the talk ["Decentralized AI" by Gene Kogan on December 12](https://anthillinside.in/2017-dec-bangalore-lecture/), which is about the intersection of artificial intelligence with decentralization technologies such as blockchains and smart contracts. Primary sub-topics include blockchain mechanics and cryptography, federated learning, and security considerations. Relevant platforms will be introduced. The tentative syllabus is as follows:

    #### Cryptography prerequisites
    
    * Public key cryptography
    * Hashing and proof-of-work
    * Smart contracts
    * TUTORIAL: Digital signatures

    #### Blockchains

    * How blockchains work
      * Bitcoin protocol
      * TUTORIAL: Proof-of-work on simple blockchain
    * Survey of cryptocurrencies
    * Second-generation blockchain applications
      * Namecoins, colored coins, smart properties, tokens
      * Distributed data, BigchainDB
    * Deconstructing blockchains
      * Blockchain as a state-transition system
      * Ethereum
    * Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO)

    #### Machine learning

    * Deep learning
      * Applications to computer vision, natural language processing
      * TUTORIAL: Basic image classifier in Keras
    * Problems with centralized machine learning
      * Data security and surveillance
      * Problems with economic model
    * Federated learning
    * Security issues with federated learning
      * Differential privacy
    * Why are blockchains relevant to machine learning?

    #### Blockchains + machine learning

    * Federated learning on a blockchain
      * Openmined
    * AI + DAOs
    * Impact of AI on decentralized applications
      * Asset management + "sharing economy"
      * Data markets and exchanges
      * Mutual funds, insurance, co-ops
    * Dangers of AI DAOs
    * Art DAOs
