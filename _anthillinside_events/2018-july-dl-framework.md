description: "We have all used all the high end frameworks that works really well. How about writing a small strip down version of one. In this session, Iâ€™ll walk you through how to write a small Deep Learning Framework in Pure python and numpy which has auto grad and optimizers and easy to create models. Also, the framework will be extendible so that you can easily play around with."

    # Socpe of the Workshop

    This will be a theory and implementation workshop. The theory part will be focused towards explaining the fundamentals and giving reasons for various design decisions of the implementations part. 

    # Sections of the workshop


    1. The basics
    2. Implementing a neural Network
    3. Computational Graph and implementing auto grad
    4. Implementing our very own nabla framework.

    # What do you need to know/have a priori!

    * A laptop with good battery backup
    * A python environment installed and ready to go (python3 and numpy latest versions)
    * Some basic knowledge in how neural networks work
