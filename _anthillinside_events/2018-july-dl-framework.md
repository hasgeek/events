    # Abstract

    We have all used all the high end frameworks that works really well. How about writing a small strip down version of one. In this session, I’ll walk you through how to write a small Deep Learning Framework in Pure python and numpy which has auto grad and optimizers and easy to create models. Also, the framework will be extendible so that you can easily play around with.

    # Pre-requisites

    * Basic Knowledge in using Python and numpy.
    * Basic knowledge in any of the modern day deep learning frameworks.
