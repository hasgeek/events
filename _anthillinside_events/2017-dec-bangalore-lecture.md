    Gene Kogan is an artist and a programmer who is interested in generative systems, artificial intelligence, and software for creativity and self-expression. He is a collaborator within numerous [open-source](https://github.com/genekogan) software projects, and leads [workshops](http://genekogan.com/workshops/) and [talks](http://genekogan.com/cv/#talks) on topics at the intersection of code and art. Gene initiated and contributes to [ml4a](https://ml4a.github.io/), a free book about machine learning for artists, activists, and citizen scientists. He regularly publishes [video lectures](http://ml4a.github.io/classes/), writings, and tutorials to facilitate a greater public understanding of the topic.



overview:
  center_content: |
    Blockchains and deep learning are two of the most promising technologies to emerge in recent years. As Bitcoin has dispersed into dozens or hundreds of viable cryptocurrencies, startups and venture capitalists are beginning to consider other alternative use cases of blockchains as a means of decentralized consensus. Meanwhile, major sectors of the financial industry, transportation infrastructure, and social media are increasingly dominated by machine learning algorithms, and AI is gradually augmenting or automating various human faculties. The influence of both of these technologies is further expanded by more of our everyday appliances getting connected to the internet and accumulating data. A primordial soup of ingredients for widespread decentralized AI is forming, and many are beginning to speculate about its potential; is it a libertarian panacea to an unjust society, or a totalitarian nightmare with no off-switch?

    ## Key takeaway / insight for the audience:

    The speculative possibilities that lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and blockchains, and a survey of the landscape of relevant technologies, platforms, and ventures.

    ## Who should attend this talk:

    If you are interested in

    * Artificial Intelligence
    * Machine Learning
    * Deep Learning
    * Blockchains and cryptocurrencies
    * Decentralization

    You should have some awareness of these technologies. Gene will review these for beginners.
