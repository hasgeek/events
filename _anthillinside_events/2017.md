    ## What is Anthill Inside?

    In 2016, The Fifth Elephant branched into a separate conference on Deep Learning. Anthill Inside is the new avataar of the Deep Learning conference. Anthill Inside attempts to bridge the gap bringing theoretical advances closer to functioning reality.

      A lot of materials are available on how to do machine learning - but hardly any cover how to put them in production and how to continue updating the model. The attendees would learn how to build a seamless end-to-end data driven application - data ingestion, exploration, machine learning, RESTful API, dashboard, and making it repeatable - to solve a business prediction problem and present it to their clients.
