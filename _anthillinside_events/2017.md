    ## What is Anthill Inside?

    In 2016, The Fifth Elephant branched into a separate conference on Deep Learning. Anthill Inside is the new avataar of the Deep Learning conference. Anthill Inside attempts to bridge the gap bringing theoretical advances closer to functioning reality.

    ## What can I expect?

    Anthill Inside is a single day conference. The conference will have full, crisp, and lightning talks from morning to evening. There are also workshops under the Anthill banner that will be held on the days following the conference. These will introduce participants to neural networks followed by two tracks of three-hour workshops on NLP and Computer Vision / AI.

      A lot of materials are available on how to do machine learning - but hardly any cover how to put them in production and how to continue updating the model. The attendees would learn how to build a seamless end-to-end data driven application - data ingestion, exploration, machine learning, RESTful API, dashboard, and making it repeatable - to solve a business prediction problem and present it to their clients.

    ## Why is this event called Anthill Inside?

    How does cognition emerge from inanimate matter? Douglas Hofstadter, explored this in Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, where he compared the human brain to a colony of ants. Individual entities — neurons or ants — he argued, can coordinate to result in interesting *emergent* behaviour; cognition in the case of neurons or an anthill in the case of an ant colony.

    Terry Pratchett built on this analogy in his Discworld novels, in which a colony of ants coordinate to make Hex, a fictional self-building computer! Hex also features a sticker that reads 'Anthill Inside', an obvious play on Intel's famous slogan. HasGeek, in turn, borrowed 'Anthill Inside' to help people working on deep learning and artificial intelligence, interact and collaborate with each other to produce something *bigger*.
