    ### JSFoo is India’s premier JavaScript conference, hosted by HasGeek.
  right_content: |
    **Update: JSFoo dates have moved from 13–14 September to 26–27 October 2018. Read more on this [here](https://medium.com/hasgeek/jsfoo-has-moved-to-26-27-october-3029d93a2d38).** 
    
    HasGeek launched JSFoo in 2011 as India’s first JavaScript conference. The JS community in India has grown phenomenally since then. JavaScript now pervades every aspect of web development – browsers, apps, front-end, backend, mobile and IoT, and there’s always scope to understand new ideas and solutions. The conference explores new ideas, implementing innovative solutions, and learning from experiences, especially negative ones!
