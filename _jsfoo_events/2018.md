    **The 2018 edition of JSFoo is now over. Check out https://hasgeek.com for the latest events.**
    > Learning JavaScript used to mean you weren't a serious software developer. Today, not learning JavaScript means the same thing. - **[Tim O'Reilly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timo3/)**

    With **JavaScript being used as much as it is talked about**, JSFoo is certainly the most needed conference this year! The reasons for its popularity are also the reasons for its vulnerability (security-wise). Hence this edition will focus broadly on **JavaScript and security**.

    Sessions at JSFoo this year will focus on the following topics:

    * The road ahead in JavaScript and the Web ecosystem
    * Functional programming
    * Improving performance and UX
    * Building systems, tools and processes for teams
    * Case studies of Vue.js, GraphQL, ReasonML and other framework/language adoption.

    ### You should attend JSFoo if you work in any of the following domains

    * Architecture of Web Apps
    * Frameworks, tools and alternatives to JS
    * Front end and its security
    * Building systems, tools and processes for teams
    * Performance and UX
    * Management and scaling of Infrastructure
    * Debugging, testing and profiling on the Web

    ## How it all began
    HasGeek hosted the first edition of JSFoo in 2011 to address the growing needs of a niche community working with Javascript.
    Since then, our JS community has grown tremendously. And this year, we’re meeting again on **26 – 27 October** to explore new ideas and developments, to implement innovative solutions, and to learn from others’ experiences.
    Want to see the quality and topics of talks at last year’s conference?
