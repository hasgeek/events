    We all love side projects, don’t we? But we don’t get enough time for them. Who knows what ideas or opportunities we may be missing out on by not working on things we actually want to. For this reason, hacknights at HasGeek are a favorite of savvy geeks. Unlike regular hackathons, hacknights at HasGeek foster collaboration among developers who are passionate about building things.
    
    We help smart developers meet by providing a collaborative environment where participants can work on their pet projects. We bring in mentors from the community to hear out project ideas and guide you on how to proceed, especially at midnight when your mind and enthusiasm hit a roadblock and no amount of coffee helps.

    If you’re passionate about technology, love to work with a community, and want to build something amazing - HasGeek’s hacknights are for you. If you’re into looking for a hackathon to participate and win prizes, this isn’t it. But if you’re in the market for a new job, our sponsor Circles.Life is looking to hire for their Singapore office. This would will be a good way to showcase your work. Also, food and snacks are on us. Sign up now, we have limited seats!
