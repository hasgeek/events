    On 14th October, we're putting together a meetup on JavaScript in the enterprise world. The purpose of putting this panel together is to bring engineering managers and leaders from large companies to talk about the following topics-
    * What are some of the code overheads / ease with running front-ends and backend with JS.
    * The challenges of new frameworks in JS and how managers have to get their teams to adapt â€“ what kind of tech debts and overheads have to be dealt with in the process?
    * The challenge of building JS teams given skill, talent pool, changing frameworks and the need to have engineers who understand front-end and backend with JS. 
    * How does browser changes impact the enterprise?
    * How do these companies give back to the JS community?

    We'll have 2 talks followed by a panel discussion to talk about these ideas. If you'd like to propose a talk, please write to shreyaskutty@hasgeek.com.

    If you'd like to get a peak into the JS in enterprise world or plan to grow your JS team in an enterprise, this meetup is a great place to talk to practitioners.
