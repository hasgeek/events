    ### JSFoo 2017 is now over. For the 2018 edition, visit [JSFoo + Meta Refresh 2018](https://jsfoo.in/2018)
    We launched JSFoo in 2011 as India’s first JavaScript conference. The JS community in India has grown phenomenally since then. JavaScript now pervades every aspect of web development – browsers, apps, front-end, backend, mobile and IoT, and there’s always scope to understand new ideas and solutions. The conference explores new ideas, implementing innovative solutions, and learning from experiences, especially negative ones!
