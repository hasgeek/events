    * Basic knowledge of Web Technology stack is expected. (after all the person is attending JSFoo duh!)
    * Knowledge of JavaScript and DOM Apis is a plus but not required.
    * D3.js, Vue.js and React redux knowledge is a super plus as will help grasp the differences super easily.

    ## Hardware Requirement:

    * Laptop and Android (>4.4) mobile
    * A laptop (with Internet connectivity) for coding.
    * A mobile phone(with gyrometer/gyroscope) and a VR device for testing the VR experiences built.

    We need VR Devices (Cardboards / Daydream View / HTC Vives) to test the VR experiences built. We can make few devices available for all participants, but if devices like Vives and Daydream Controllers can be arranged so it will be a super plus.
