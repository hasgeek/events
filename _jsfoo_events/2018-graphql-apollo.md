    GraphQL is a powerful technology for building modern apps. It improves performance of apps by enabling clients to query only the data they require. GraphQL features help us build maintainable and scalable API servers. It also enables us to build libraries like Apollo, which reduce the complexity of client side code.

    Apollo is a GraphQL client library that can be used with any framework like React, Angular, Vue.  Declarative data fetching mechanism of Apollo significantly reduces the complexity of client side apps. It also provide out of the box support for feature like caching, pagination, subscriptions which further simplifies client side code.

    On day 1 of this workshop, you will learn all the concepts required for building API servers with GraphQL. On day 2, you will learn how to leverage Apollo to build complex apps with React and connect to GraphQL servers
