    Web Application security is a must have requirement for any organisation with business critical web applications deployed internally or external to the organisation. The number of application security related incidents reported by even large organisations in the recent past have confirmed the urgency to ensure that application security is handled as an important requirement for business continuity.

    Developing web applications is now easier than ever! Between countless tutorials and results for “How to do X in Node.js”, developers often miss out on security. In this workshop we will exploit OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in Damn Vulnerable NodeJS Application and gain hands-on experience in fixing them.
