    **Pace up with Vue**

    A frontend library, despite no corporate backing, grew tremendously with the democratic powers of a lovely community. 

    Vue is third most used JavaScript framework and if we trust the developers, it is the most liked (highest number of Github  stars). From the ground up, it is built to be approachable, versatile, performant and with high regards to developer experience. It extends prominent web technologies like HTML and CSS and super-charges them with latest advancements in the componentized web world.

    Though the core library focuses on the view layer but an ecosystem of tools and plugins which integrates deeply, provide a framework that is capable of building applications at scale.

    This workshop is crash course for JavaScript developers to know the fundamentals of Vue and by the end of day be able to develop elegant, debuggable, maintainable, and organized applications.
