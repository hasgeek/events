    ### How it all began
  
    HasGeek launched JSFoo in 2011 as India’s first JavaScript conference. The JS community in India has grown phenomenally since then. JavaScript now prevades every aspect of web development - browsers, apps, front-end, back-end, mobile and IoT. There is always scope to understand new ideas and solutions. JSFoo explores new ideas, implementing innovative solutions, and learning from experiences and anti-patterns.
