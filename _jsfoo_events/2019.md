    ## How it all began
    HasGeek hosted the first edition of JSFoo in 2011 to address the growing needs of a niche community working with Javascript.
    Since then, our JS community has grown tremendously. And this year, we’re meeting again on **27 – 28 September** to explore new ideas and developments, to implement innovative solutions, and to learn from others’ experiences.
