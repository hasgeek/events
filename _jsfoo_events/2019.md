    JSFoo is HasGeek’s annual JavaScript conference. JSFoo is in its ninth edition this year. The 2019 edition is a two-track event with talks and Birds of Feather (BOF) sessions in auditorium 1 and auditorium 2 at the NIMHANS Convention Centre.

    Sessions at JSFoo this year will focus on the following topics:

    * The road ahead in JavaScript and the Web ecosystem
    * Functional programming
    * Improving performance and UX
    * Building systems, tools and processes for teams
    * Case studies of Vue.js, GraphQL, ReasonML and other framework/language adoption.

    ## Theme

    The 2019 edition is a single-track event with talks in auditorium 1, Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions and round tables at the NIMHANS Convention Centre.

    The theme for JSFoo 2019 is component architecture. Our web applications these days are typically composed of multiple components such as React, Angular, Vue, Ember and, others. We’d therefore like to hear talks about:

    *  How do you architect applications with numerous components? What complexities arise in the process? How do you mitigate these complexities?
    *  Case studies about apps that have two components for front-end. Is your app’s front-end architected with Angular and Vue, for example? In which case, how does front-end and backend technology work? Tell us more.
    *  What is the workflow, process and organization of web development teams working on apps that have multiple components?

    **Talks on component architecture will form the core of JSFoo talks for the first session, on both the days. Apart from this, we are accepting talks on:**

    * JavaScript and security, including framework-specific security concerns (node.js and exploits, for example), authentication and, security audits.
    * Latest developments in JavaScript and the web ecosystem – the cutting edge.
    * Best practices: debugging and profiling on the web, testing, measuring performance.
    * JS off the web – conversational UI, Raspberry Pi, IoT, JS and music.

    ### You should attend JSFoo if you work in any of the following domains

    * Architecture of Web Apps
    * Frameworks, tools and alternatives to JS
    * Front end and its security
    * Building systems, tools and processes for teams
    * Performance and UX
    * Management and scaling of Infrastructure
    * Debugging, testing and profiling on the Web

    ## How it all began
    HasGeek hosted the first edition of JSFoo in 2011 to address the growing needs of a niche community working with Javascript.
    Since then, our JS community has grown tremendously. And this year, we’re meeting again on **27 – 28 September** to explore new ideas and developments, to implement innovative solutions, and to learn from others’ experiences.
