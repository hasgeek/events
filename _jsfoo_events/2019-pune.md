overview:
  left_content: |
    ### JSFoo is India’s premier JavaScript conference, hosted by HasGeek.

    The Pune edition is the second edition (earlier, we had organized JSFoo in Pune in 2012, and ReactFoo in January 2019).
  right_content: |
    HasGeek launched JSFoo in 2011 as India’s first JavaScript conference. The JS community in India has grown phenomenally since then. JavaScript now pervades every aspect of web development – browsers, apps, front-end, backend, mobile and IoT, and there’s always scope to understand new ideas and solutions. The conference explores new ideas, implementing innovative solutions, and learning from experiences, especially negative ones!

    Want to see the quality and topics of talks at last year's conference? You can watch the [JSFoo 2018 videos](https://hasgeek.tv/jsfoo){:target="_blank"} or the related [ReactFoo 2018 videos](https://hasgeek.tv/reactfoo){:target="_blank"} to see what was on trend.
