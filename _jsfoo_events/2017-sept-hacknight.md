    Hacknights at HasGeek are a favorite of savvy geeks. Unlike regular hackathons, hacknights at HasGeek foster collaboration among developers who are passionate about building things. If you're into looking for a hackathon to participate and win prizes, this isn't it. But if you're passionate about technology, love to work with a community, and want to build something amazing. HasGeek's hacknights are for you. Did we mention the mentoring by industry professionals? There's that, too. Sign up now!
