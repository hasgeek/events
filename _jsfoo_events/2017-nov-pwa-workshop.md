    Progressive web apps are no longer considered an alternative to native mobile apps, instead they are evolving to becoming the de-facto way of building web apps.
    
    Angular’s vision is to get to a point where every Angular application deployed to production is by default AOT compiled and is a PWA.

    During the workshop participants will fork a regular Angular application and will go about converting it into a PWA.
    Some of the items we will learn during the workshop are:

    * Toolset to improve your developer productivity while working with Angular. 
    * Leveraging Angular CLI and other core modules to build out a Minimum Viable PWA (MVP)
    * Add mobile installable capabilities via manifest.
    * Universal Rendering for the App shell.
    * Offline caching for static and dynamic content.
    * Setting up caching strategies between offline first and network first.
    * UX guidelines & best practices for offline first apps.
    * Adding Push notifications. 
    * Deploying to firebase. 
    * Allowing transactions in offline mode via background sync.
