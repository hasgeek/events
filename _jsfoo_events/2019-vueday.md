      ### Why JSFoo: VueDay?

      In the third week of March 2019, Vue.js became the most starred project on GitHub. The organic growth of the community around Vue.js is notable.

      The community in India is gradually taking off. Large and small Indian companies are among the early adopters of Vue.js and NativeScript (for mobile). Below are some of the case studies we have featured at HasGeek events in 2018:

         1. [https://hasgeek.com/jsfoo/2019-pune/proposals/the-vuetiful-journey-from-angularjs-to-vue-migrati-viQja9N7G6auVWkLniFFgD](https://hasgeek.com/jsfoo/2019-pune/proposals/the-vuetiful-journey-from-angularjs-to-vue-migrati-viQja9N7G6auVWkLniFFgD)
         2. [https://hasgeek.tv/reactfoo/hyderabad/1472-react-to-vue-why-and-how-rahul-kadyan](https://hasgeek.tv/reactfoo/hyderabad/1472-react-to-vue-why-and-how-rahul-kadyan)
         3. [https://hasgeek.tv/jsfoo/2018-day-1/1594-vuejs-at-olacabs](https://hasgeek.tv/jsfoo/2018-day-1/1594-vuejs-at-olacabs)

      JSFoo: VueDay is a conference in response to the community’s growing needs to discuss:

         1. Tooling with Vue and Vue CLI.
         2. NativeScript as an alternative for building cross-platform apps
         3. Component architecture with Vue – building web applications with Vue as one of the components in the architecture
         4. Web standards and Vue.js
         5. Vue 3 - to be released.

       **If you are interested in participating in JSFoo: VueDay, submit a talk/tutorial/workshop/BOF proposal here. Proposal submissions close on 15 May 2019.**
