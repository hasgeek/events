    ### About Fragments Ahmedabad:State of Platforms
    
    The Ahmedabad edition of Fragments Conference is a technical, deep-dive conference, discussing:
    
    * React: where Vipul AM, director at Big Binary, elaborates [on tooling, resources and how to get started with React] (https://hasgeek.com/fragments/ahmedabad-2019/proposals/state-of-react-BDg5te9DaeahZN9kVaahRV)
    * React Native: working with the React Native team at Facebook in San Francisco, Parashuram explains [how you can build high quality applications with React Native](https://hasgeek.com/fragments/ahmedabad-2019/proposals/building-high-quality-mobile-apps-with-react-nativ-T4xVLyEQFFGKzgvNsdRuta)
    * Flutter: Pooja Bhaumik explains [the ease of development with Flutter in terms of reduced development times, ease of learning, and other technical features which make Flutter an attractive platform](https://hasgeek.com/fragments/ahmedabad-2019/proposals/flutter-a-nightmare-for-freelancers-jbAn8PKhyFgna44bvJ8fHf)
    * Comparisons of the above platforms with Kotlin and NativeScript: Arnav Gupta, known for his active involvement with the Android community, demonstrates [the pros and cons of different platforms by showing how he built an app using Kotlin, Flutter and NativeScript](https://hasgeek.com/fragments/ahmedabad-2019/proposals/what-i-learnt-by-building-the-exact-same-app-in-ko-NuZgd4bLfKkcck2yHEGRmg)
    * **While platforms have brought in frameworks and ease of development, at the heart of a good mobile app underlies sound engineering.** One such practice is that of end-to-end testing. Preeti Wadhwani argues about [the importance of E2E testing, in her talk at the conference](https://hasgeek.com/fragments/ahmedabad-2019/proposals/meet-my-new-friend-testing-Y5FuAn6jCmXDdyL7o72LtM)
    * We have organized a flash talks session for audience to showcase their open source work, and contribute to the above discussions. **See the full conference schedule [here](https://hasgeek.com/fragments/ahmedabad-2019/schedule)**
