    On 2nd September, weâ€™re putting together a meetup at Zoho. In this meetup, we hope to cover a variety of topics addressing various aspects of the mobile ecosystem. We're also accepting a couple of flash talks at the meetup. Flash talks are talks of 5-8 minutes. If you're interested in proposing a flash talk, please drop an email to shreyaskutty@hasgeek.com.
    We'll have a series of talks on the following topics.

    * Talk 1: Engineering for Good Design by Mario Stallone. Product, engineering, and design makes up the three pillars of a successful product. Empathising with each other's roles in the product life cycle, while sharing feedback and inputs with each other can sometimes get tricky. In this talk, Mario will share his experience, and how he has learned to empathize and work more closely with designers and product managers.
    * Talk 2: Freshworks' journey towards cross platform development by Girish Koundinya. Building applications for multiple platforms is challenging. As a product grows and becomes feature rich, replicating use cases while maintaining individuality of the platform becomes very hard and usually, every engineering team comes across a scenario where they have to dabble with cross platform development. This talk is about how they approached this problem and what they've learned from it. 
    * Talk 3: TBD

    If you'd like to get a sense of the mobile ecosystem and interact with practitioners from the industry, this is a great place to be. RSVP now to reserve your spot!
