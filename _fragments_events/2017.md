    ## What happened to droidconIN?

    We've been organizing droidconIN since 2011 and while the mobile development landscape has been changing rapidly since, we have not. With the maturing of the mobile ecosystem, we are seeing more and more collaboration between mobile platform teams. The rise of cross platform frameworks and a drive for feature and design parity across platforms mean teams need to understand the mobile app ecosystem as whole, not just Android or iOS.

    Building on this trend, we've decided to launch Fragments - a community and conference that covers the mobile ecosystem as a whole. Well cover topics across Android, iOS, and even advancements in the mobile web, such as Progressive Web Apps.
