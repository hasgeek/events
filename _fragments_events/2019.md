    #### What you can expect from the Bangalore edition of Fragments on 30 March:

    Fragments was launched in response to the fragmented nature of engineering and software development for mobile. Much changed for mobile engineering in 2017 when React Native entered the landscape and cross-platform mobile development took off in a big way.
    At the recently concluded [ReactFoo](https://hasgeek.com/reactfoo/2019/), we talked not only about the ecosystem emerging with ReactFoo, but also how organizations are structuring teams for Android, iOS and cross-platform mobile development.
    Coming back to Fragments, the Android versus iOS debate seems to be settled with Android winning the turf. Now, with Flutter taking off as a platform for mobile engineering, the battleground has opened between React Native versus Flutter. Who will win is not only a matter of adoption and user base metrics, but also which platform has a stronger community around it. **On 30 March, speakers [Priyanka Sabhagani](https://hasgeek.com/fragments/2019/proposals/which-one-is-for-me-react-native-or-flutter-or-nat-sXvMuiYGRbeZNQPMkoEJS6) and [Ajin Asokan](https://hasgeek.com/fragments/2019/proposals/flutter-zero-to-production-in-3-months-building-in-ZRTxYwQuA45GBYD3WNEwd5) will share BookMyShow’s and Zerodha’s experiences (respectively) with React Native and Flutter, helping participants evaluate each platform’s strength and weaknesses.** We look forward to deeper discussions around Flutter, where the platform has piqued a great deal of interest from developers (who have to write less code), but greater skepticism about Flutter’s capabilities with respect to data storage and related issues from senior developers.
    
    Apart from Flutter, the Bangalore edition of Fragments will feature talks on [Kotlin](https://hasgeek.com/fragments/2019/proposals/architectures-with-kotlin-multiplatform-Q8jaotTCA9aE4bBNj73u4m) and native app development. An interesting question to discuss here is the decision to go native versus when not to go native with your app. Which factors inform such a decision?

    **The other discussion which [Raghunath Jawahar, Varsha Saha and Abhinav Rastogi](https://hasgeek.com/fragments/2019/proposals/adopting-web-front-end-architectures-for-native-mo-4r8uSq2LLYHpZPevP4zRgX) will take up is what native app developers can learn from the mature web front-end architectures.** The discussion will steer around the following topics:
    1. The dynamic nature of JavaScript versus static languages like Java/Kotlin/Swift which is used to develop native mobile apps.
    2. Expectations and user experience on web versus mobile.
    3. The asynchronous nature of mobile platforms and their lifecycles – the unique challenges this factor presents.

    **Finally, Fragments Bangalore will showcase talks on:**

    1.  [Image uploads](https://hasgeek.com/fragments/2019/proposals/image-uploads-for-mobile-web-o6uvGb4wNNcH3SXU2n9SXo) and [Constraint and Motion layout](https://hasgeek.com/fragments/2019/proposals/responsive-ui-with-constraint-and-motion-layout-P3znDTVcXQJ3LsYa6wV8dH).
    2. [Optimizing the size of your mobile app](https://hasgeek.com/fragments/2019/proposals/how-to-optimize-app-size-to-below-10-mb-wUnQtqZDcGbeVpGXQveyQJ).
    3. [Voice, and its role in building augmented experiences for mobile apps](https://hasgeek.com/fragments/2019/proposals/building-next-generational-voice-augmented-experie-Zey2CYpCfxeaQr37nvMEYY).
    4. [How the concept of Seams can be applied for building flexible and testable apps](https://hasgeek.com/fragments/2019/proposals/building-next-generational-voice-augmented-experie-Zey2CYpCfxeaQr37nvMEYY).
    5. [Building predictable and high performance workflows for mobile app engineering](https://hasgeek.com/fragments/2019/schedule/building-predictable-and-high-performance-workflows-for-mobile-app-development-BJnncT5K7novHXU4i8oYJh).

    **Who should attend Fragments 2019 in Bangalore?**
    * Mobile engineers working on Android and cross-platform apps
    * Senior developers and tech leads
    * Backend developers and full-stack engineers
    * Product managers
    * Product engineers

    ## What happened to droidconIN?

    We've been organizing droidconIN since 2011 and while the mobile development landscape has been changing rapidly since, we have not. With the maturing of the mobile ecosystem, we are seeing more and more collaboration between mobile platform teams. The rise of cross platform frameworks and a drive for feature and design parity across platforms mean teams need to understand the mobile app ecosystem as whole, not just Android or iOS.

    Building on this trend, we decided to launch Fragments in 2017 - a community and conference that covers the mobile ecosystem as a whole. We will cover topics across Android, iOS, and even advancements in the mobile web, such as Progressive Web Apps.
