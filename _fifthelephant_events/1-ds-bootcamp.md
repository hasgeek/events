    ### Day 5: Full Stack Data Science

    - Overview of the case
    - Build Simple ML model (linear/logistic regression)
    - Creating RESTful API
    - Integrating model output to DB
    - Updating the model as more data comes in (batch only - no streaming)
    - A simple webpage front-end to visualise the results and interact with the API.
    - Creating a simple application that accomplishes this end-to-end


    ## Target Audience
    - **A programmer but not a data science practioner**: A programmer with experience in server-side or front-end development and maybe has some familiarity with doing data analysis. You could be looking to transition in to building data driven products or a create a richer product experience with data.
    - **A data science practioner but not a programmer**: A data science newbie with some experience in doing data analysis, preferably in a scripting language (R/Python/Scala), but wants to get a deeper and a more richer experience in data science.

    ##  Pre-requisites
    - Programming knowledge is mandatory. Attendee should be able to write conditional statements, use loops, be comfortable writing functions and be able to understand code snippets and come up with programming logic.
    - Participants should have a basic familiarity of Python. Specifically, we expect participants to know the first three sections from this: [http://anandology.com/python-practice-book/](http://anandology.com/python-practice-book/)

    ## Software Requirements
    We will be using Python data stack for the workshop. Please install Ananconda for Python 3.5 for the workshop. Additional requirement will be communicated to participants.
