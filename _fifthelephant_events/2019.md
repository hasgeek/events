    The eighth edition of The Fifth Elephant will be held in Bangalore on 25-26 July. A thousand data scientists, ML engineers, data engineers and analysts will gather at the NIMHANS Convention Centre in Bangalore to discuss:

    1. Model management, including data cleaning, instrumentation and productionizing data science
    2. Bad data and case studies of failure in building data products
    3. Identifying and handling fraud + data security at scale
    4. Applications of data science in agriculture, media and marketing, supply chain, geo-location, SaaS and e-commerce
    5. Feature engineering and ML platforms
    6. What it takes to create data-driven cultures in organisations of different scales

    **Format:**

    The Fifth Elephant is a two-day conference with two tracks on each day.

    Sessions at The Fifth Elephant are of the following formats:

    1. Full talks of 40 minutes.
    2. Crisp talks of 20 minutes.

      3. Attend tutorials on Deep Learning with RedisAI; TransmorgifyAI, Salesforceâ€™s open source AutoML.
      4. Discuss interesting problems to solve with data science in agriculture, SaaS perspective on multi-tenancy in Machine Learning (with the Freshworks team), bias in intent classification and recommendations.
      5. Meet data science, data engineering and product teams from sponsoring companies to understand how they are handling data and leveraging intelligence from data to solve interesting problems.

      **Why you should attend?**

        1. Network with peers and practitioners from the data ecosystem
        2. Share approaches to solving expensive problems such as cleanliness of training data, model management and versioning data
        3. Demo your ideas in the demo session
        4. Meet data science, data engineering and product teams from sponsoring companies to understand how they are handling data and leveraging intelligence from data to solve interesting problems
