overview:
  left_content: |
    In this workshop, you will learn how to use Amazon SageMaker to build, train and host machine learning models. Going through a number of Jupyter notebooks, you will first learn how to use built-in algorithms to perform complex tasks like image classification or clustering. Then, trainers will teach you how you can bring your own Tensorflow or Apache MXNet script to train deep learning models. Finally, you will deploy your models to SageMaker-managed infrastructure and use them to predict new samples.

    #### Topics Covered:

    - What Amazon SageMaker is
    - How to build end-to-end machine learning workflows on Amazon SageMaker
    - How to use built-in ML algorithms for classification, image recognition, etc.
    - How to bring your own model, your own training code, etc.

    And more..


    ## Who should attend?
    
    Technology leaders from Startups and Enterprises  (Engineering, Architecture, Product, Development) who are interested in expanding your knowledge on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and how it can be applied to your business. 

    **Note: This workshop is sponsored by AWS and they will be collecting participants data for generating coupons. These credits are exclusively for hands-on labs. We will be opening up RSVP for this workshop shortly.**

    4. **Notebook demo on using highly** -optimized built-in Amazon algorithms [Duration: 30 mins.]
    5. **Hands-on lab** – Managed Training, Hosting and A/B Testing of Amazon built-in algorithm – Amazon linear learner algorithm / parallel training using SageMaker Estimators / SageMaker Python SDK [Duration: 45 mins.]
    6. **Hands-on lab** – Build your own DNNs using MXNet/Tensorflow, distributed training on GPUs and serving using SageMaker [Duration: 1 hr. 15 mins.]
    7. **Integration with Amazon Elastic Map Reduce (Managed Hadoop Service)** - Amazon SageMaker notebooks backed by Spark in Amazon EMR [Duration: 1 hr.]



    ## Pre-requisites

    - Participants should have an AWS Account with admin privileges in IAM and EC2 limit for P2 instances increased to 2 in AWS Region North Virginia (us-east-1). Check out [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html) doc to know more about how to increase EC2 limits. All participants will be provided AWS Credits for the workshop
    - Participants should carry own laptop.
    - Participants should be familiar with AI / ML / DL and need to be hands-on practitioners.
