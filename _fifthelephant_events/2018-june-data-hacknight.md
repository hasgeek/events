    Innovations powered by data are solving a wide range of issues faced by patients, hospitals and the healthcare industry overall. Recently, the Government of India has announced the Electronic Medical Records standard for private firms and hospitals to collect and store medical data of patients through interoperable mechanisms, and increased spending on healthcare budget.

    This hacknight we want you to explore healthcare issues and build prototypes for problems using data. Your project could achieve one of the below objectives or you could come with something on your own:

    * To build solutions to offer cheap and better alternatives for standardised healthcare data collection.
    * To improve healthcare solutions for rare diseases and advanced detection of curable healthcare issues.
    * To improve management in hospitals with increased coordination between doctors and nursing staff. 
    * To improve quality of life an average citizen using tools that address air pollution, clean water, better sanitation, etc.
    
    [Here](https://github.com/hasgeek/public-lists/blob/master/list-of-public-datasets-related-to-healthcare.md) is a compiled list of public datasets related to healthcare. Feel free to choose this or any other datasets which you know. If you find any relevant dataset missing in this list, send us a pull request.
