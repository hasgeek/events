overview:
  left_content: |
    In this workshop, you will learn how to use Amazon SageMaker to build, train and host machine learning models. Going through a number of Jupyter notebooks, you will first learn how to use built-in algorithms to perform complex tasks like image classification or clustering. Then, trainers will teach you how you can bring your own Tensorflow or Apache MXNet script to train deep learning models. Finally, you will deploy your models to SageMaker-managed infrastructure and use them to predict new samples.

    #### Topics Covered:

    - What Amazon SageMaker is
    - How to build end-to-end machine learning workflows on Amazon SageMaker
    - How to use built-in ML algorithms for classification, image recognition, etc.
    - How to bring your own model, your own training code, etc.

    And more..


    ## Who should attend?
    
    Technology leaders from Startups and Enterprises  (Engineering, Architecture, Product, Development) who are interested in expanding your knowledge on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and how it can be applied to your business. 

    *Note: This workshop is sponsored by AWS and the data collected for this workshop will be shared with them.*
