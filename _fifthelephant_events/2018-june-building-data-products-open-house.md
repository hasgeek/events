    Data is the core of all things at Uber and every aspect of the Uber experience is powered by data - this ranges from systems that connect the rider to a driver, predict the correct fare for your ride, calculate in-app ETAs, optimal routing for Uber pool, restaurant recommendations in Uber eats, to online fraud detection. The Data org at Uber is a central team that builds the foundational services and platforms that power Uber's analytics, machine learning, AI, & business intelligence applications. This talk will focus on the infrastructure and platforms that Uber have internally built that power data ingestion, storage, streaming/batch analytics, and machine learning for thousands of operators, data scientists, and engineers at Uber. In this talk, speaker will also cover some unique challenges relating to managing their petabyte scale data lake across a hybrid on-prem & cloud based infrastructure. Speaker will do a deep dive into Uber’s batch analytics infrastructure comprising of Hadoop/HDFS, Hive, Spark, Presto, and YARN/Mesos/Peloton and how these systems help them build the foundation required for the next 5 years of growth.
