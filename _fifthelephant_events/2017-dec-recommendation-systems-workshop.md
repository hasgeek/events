    > Sure. I do marathons.... on Netflix

    In the digital world, recommendation systems play a significant role - both for the users and for the company/platform/sellers.

    For the users, a new world of options are thrown up - that were hitherto tough to find. For companies, it helps drive up user engagement and satisfaction, directly impacting their bottom line.

    If you've shopped on e-commerce platforms like Amazon or Flipkart, you would've seen options like:  

    *"People who viewed this product also viewed..."*  
    *"Products similar to this one..."*

    These are the results from recommendation systems.

    Netflix threw up a major data science challenge last decade: a million dollars to anyone who can improve their recommendation system by 10%. A recent [estimate](http://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-recommendation-engine-worth-1-billion-per-year-2016-6) pegs the value of Netflix's recommendation system to be worth $ 1 Billion.

    In this full-day workshop, we will walk you through the various types of recommendation system. By the end of the workshop, you will have enough knowledge to build one for your problem.

    **Pre-requisites**

    The workshop is approximately 50% theory and 50% hands-on. 

    1. Programming knowledge and basics of Python is necessary to follow the hands-on part. 
    2. No machine learning knowledge is assumed.
    3. Basics of Linear Algebra will be good-to-have.

    **Software requirements**

    We will be doing this on cloud. Laptop with a browser is all you need for the workshop.
