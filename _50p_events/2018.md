To unlock those possibilities you need to know your way around and ask the right questions. This talk is a sort of techno-business map that we’ve plotted from our own journeys in the UPI universe. We will look at how UPI is architected, the APIs it exposes, the payment experiences that it enables and then dive deep into a couple of payment flow implementations to see how things really work under the hood.

  blurb: How functional programming techniques and a fully Javascript based app development platform helped us to build BHIM & *99# in 3 weeks. We created BHIM and it’s USSD counterpart *99# in just 3 weeks. This was primarily because of adoption of pure functional programming techniques and usage of a custom built javascript based app development framework. Javascript unified multiple platforms and had an impact on reducing the overall effort. Functional programming techniques enabled multiple teams to work in a hyper parallel mode and assemble components in a robust way in a short timespan. Here we share our learnings.
