discussions:
- talk_title: "Panel: UPI - Looking back and future roadmap"
  blurb: UPI has seen a rapid growth and the adoption is only going to increase over the next year. If you're building apps and services on top of UPI, there are a lot of unanswered questions. This Birds of a Feather session aims to provide a discussion space for all stakeholders in the UPI platform to come together and discuss the pain points, quirks and what lies ahead for UPI.
- talk_title: "Panel: Security measures in FinTech"
  blurb: The prevalence of FinTech in India has seen a large boom in the past year. With every company jumping in on the bandwagon, security is usually an after thought in FinTech. The panel on Security in FinTech aims to demistify some of the common security pitfalls and explores the best practices for security in FinTech. Panelists and moderators will be announced soon.
- talk_title: "BoF: Information Security in Fintech and how to handle breaches"
  blurb: Learn how to monitor for data breaches and prevent them in the first place to avoid losing valuable data to hackers and vulnerabilities. Set up checks and measures in your company along with a contingency plan to handle a breach. This BoF will help you learn how to get started with thinking about security from practitioners and security experts.
- talk_title: "Panel: Future of PoS"
  blurb: PoS devices have changed rapidly in the last year, from being a device to only accept cards, to now allowing payments through UPI, BharatQR, contactless and even offers services like EMIs and cashback offers. The panel will review the past year in PoS devices, the developments, policies around MDR and new and emerging technologies.
- talk_title: "Panel: Regulation for innovation"
  blurb: We've seen several regulations come out for the FinTech industry in 2017. Most of these regulations seem to be reactive than pro-active. Are these regulations inhibiting innovation in the industry? Are some players being given unfair advantages? What happened to the Watal Committee recommendations? The panel aims to address all these with particpants from NBFCs, policy institutions, industry stalwarts and regulators.
