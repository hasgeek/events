      ### 50p is an independent conference on payments and the payment ecosystem.
      50p was launched in 2017 to interrogate critical moments such as demonetization, to question the binary of cash versus digital payments, and to create greater awareness in the ecosystem about [policies]((https://youtu.be/itqLNmQ_0lI)), [regulations](https://youtu.be/ZeolwOp9sk8) and the importance of [openness](https://youtu.be/KRxPwZjO-z8).

      50p was hosted in Bangalore and Mumbai in 2017. Our approach has been interdisciplinary where every participant has been exposed to policy, technology and customer acquisition issues underlying payments.

      For the 2018 edition, to be hosted on 8 and 9 February, we have taken a different approach. The main focus of the conference content would be the engineers working in payment companies:
      1. Building payment products in India – for engineers, entrepreneurs, product managers and those involved in customer acquisition and retention.
      2. Banking technology and technology stack used in payments companies – aimed at developers, architects, CTOs and technology teams.
      3. UPI, BharatQR, AEPS and other payment instruments as well as policies such as DBT (Direct Beneficiary Transfers) for those working on interoperability.
      4. Data science and fraud in transactions for technologists, data scientists, ML practitioners and analysts.
      5. Cryptocurrencies for enthusiasts and communities.
      You can choose to speak at, or participate on any one of the days of the conference.

    Meanwhile, you should attend or submit a proposal to speak at 50p if you are:
    1. Developer – working on micro services, architecture, design, or any technology stack in payments,
    2. Product manager, Economic historian, Banking expert, Advocate,
    3. Data scientist working on payments and transaction fraud, Security expert,
    4. or a policy maker.

    50p is a conference for practitioners, by practitioners. Tell us about your journey with technology in payments,successes and failures in reaching out to new markets, innovative payment hacks for India, and new developments. We are all eyes and ears.

  image_url: https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/p/3/005/04e/22c/13b5765.jpg
  blurb: UPI is one of those innovations that come along every once in a while and transform the landscape. By reducing friction in payments, it has opened up new product possibilities. To unlock those possibilities you need to know your way around and ask the right questions. This talk is a sort of techno-business map that we’ve plotted from our own journeys in the UPI universe. We will look at how UPI is architected, the APIs it exposes, the payment experiences that it enables and then dive deep into a couple of payment flow implementations to see how things really work under the hood.

  talk_title: "What we learnt building BHIM in just 3 weeks"
  funnel_url: https://50p.talkfunnel.com/2018/10-what-we-learnt-building-bhim-in-just-3-weeks
  designation: CEO, Juspay
  image_url: https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/p/2/000/193/01d/1973d5d.jpg
  blurb: How functional programming techniques and a fully Javascript based app development platform helped us to build BHIM & *99# in 3 weeks. We created BHIM and it’s USSD counterpart *99# in just 3 weeks. This was primarily because of adoption of pure functional programming techniques and usage of a custom built javascript based app development framework. Javascript unified multiple platforms and had an impact on reducing the overall effort. Functional programming techniques enabled multiple teams to work in a hyper parallel mode and assemble components in a robust way in a short timespan. Here we share our learnings.
