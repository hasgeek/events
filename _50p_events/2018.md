      ### 50p is India's first independent conference on payments and the payment ecosystem.
      50p was launched in 2017 to interrogate critical moments such as demonetization, to question the binary of cash versus digital payments, and to create greater awareness in the ecosystem about [policies]((https://youtu.be/itqLNmQ_0lI)), [regulations](https://youtu.be/ZeolwOp9sk8) and the importance of [openness](https://youtu.be/KRxPwZjO-z8).

      50p was hosted in Bangalore and Mumbai in 2017. Our approach has been interdisciplinary where every participant has been exposed to policy, technology and customer acquisition issues underlying payments.

      For the 2018 edition, to be hosted on 8 and 9 February, we have taken a different approach. The main focus of the conference content would be the engineers working in payment companies:
      1. Building payment products in India – for engineers, entrepreneurs, product managers and those involved in customer acquisition and retention.
      2. Banking technology and technology stack used in payments companies – aimed at developers, architects, CTOs and technology teams.
      3. UPI, BharatQR, AEPS and other payment instruments as well as policies such as DBT (Direct Beneficiary Transfers) for those working on interoperability.
      4. Data science and fraud in transactions for technologists, data scientists, ML practitioners and analysts.
      5. Cryptocurrencies for enthusiasts and communities.
      You can choose to speak at, or participate on any one of the days of the conference.
  right_content: |
    Meanwhile, you should attend or submit a proposal to speak at 50p if you are:
    1. Developer – working on micro services, architecture, design, or any technology stack in payments,
    2. Product manager, Economic historian, Banking expert, Advocate,
    3. Data scientist working on payments and transaction fraud, Security expert,
    4. or a policy maker.

    50p is a conference for practitioners, by practitioners. Tell us about your journey with technology in payments,successes and failures in reaching out to new markets, innovative payment hacks for India, and new developments. We are all eyes and ears.

  blurb: Udbhav is a Policy Officer who works on matters relating to cyber security, digital payments, privacy and artificial intelligence. Information breaches are a serious concern for businesses and consumers alike. Businesses risk losing customer data, trust and even revenue when a breach happens. For cunsumers, they risk getting personally identifiable data out in the open, which can be misused. The talk will walk through the liabilities of each party involved in an information breach, what the best practices are and how can such a situation be handled.

  image_url: https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/p/3/005/04e/22c/13b5765.jpg
  blurb: UPI is one of those innovations that come along every once in a while and transform the landscape. By reducing friction in payments, it has opened up new product possibilities. To unlock those possibilities you need to know your way around and ask the right questions. This talk is a sort of techno-business map that we’ve plotted from our own journeys in the UPI universe. We will look at how UPI is architected, the APIs it exposes, the payment experiences that it enables and then dive deep into a couple of payment flow implementations to see how things really work under the hood.

  image_url: https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/p/2/000/193/01d/1973d5d.jpg
  blurb: How functional programming techniques and a fully Javascript based app development platform helped us to build BHIM & *99# in 3 weeks. We created BHIM and it’s USSD counterpart *99# in just 3 weeks. This was primarily because of adoption of pure functional programming techniques and usage of a custom built javascript based app development framework. Javascript unified multiple platforms and had an impact on reducing the overall effort. Functional programming techniques enabled multiple teams to work in a hyper parallel mode and assemble components in a robust way in a short timespan. Here we share our learnings.

  designation: Director, Appsecco
  image_url: https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAwxAAAAJGU2MjRhNjc3LWVhYmEtNDM5NS1hNjk4LWNiMDA2YzBmNzliMA.jpg
  blurb: Attackers have been using OSINT techniques against HVT successfully to identify and exploit information assets. Unfortunately, conventional security assessment and guidance doesn’t address these exposures very well. This talk delves into what are some of the techniques Fintech companies should be using to build a complete picture of its Internet exposed assets. Once this big picture is available, they can figure out ways of staying secure. Based on the techniques described, we will also share some of our findings. We will present aggregates around the various security issues discovered and general mitigations for those.

  talk_title: "Building SCALABLE blockchain apps with IPDB (InterPlanetary Database)"
  funnel_url: https://50p.talkfunnel.com/2018/3-building-scalable-blockchain-apps-with-ipdb-interp
  designation: CTO, Truweight
  image_url: https://www.nileshtrivedi.com/img/nilesh.jpeg
  blurb: Storing large amounts of structured, queryable data on public blockchain is prohibitively expensive (22 million USD for 1GB of storage!). Private, permissioned blockchain databases suffer from centralization/censorship risks and are only suitable for a narrow range of apps. IPDB offers a very nice sweet spot for trust, performance, and cost. In this talk, I teach you how IPDB works and how to build apps (centralized/decentralized/distributed) to get the benefits of blockchain - while being scalable, high-performance and low-cost. I also tell you how various upcoming IETF standards like CryptoConditions, InterLedger Protocol, Ocean Protocol fit together and provide you infrastructure for your projects - for both enterprise and consumer space.

  image_url: https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/p/3/000/1eb/2cf/08f9f41.jpg
  blurb: Blockchain and ICOs are the new buzzword of our times. But the real potential of blockchain lies in providing a new incentivisation mechanism through crypto-tokens. Cryptoeconomics is the branch which deals with design of mechanisms for incentivising desired goals in a blockchain based systems. In this talk, I will discuss the fundamentals of cryptoeconomics and how it can be used for protocol design on blockchain. Audience will learn about fundamentals of cryptoeconomics, how it can be used for designing incentives for blockchain projects and introduction to mechanism design. It will be a beginner level talk, so any one broadly interested in blockchain technologies can attend the talk.

  talk_title: "Turning Morality into Math: AI Ethics for India"
  funnel_url: https://50p.talkfunnel.com/2018/9-turning-morality-into-math-ai-ethics-for-india
  designation: Head of Data Science, Simpl
  blurb: Fairness in AI is the intersection of analytical philosophy and mathematics; the goal is to specify an ethical system so accurately and completely that it can be implemented in computer code. In this talk, I’ll discuss what an AI/ML system will and won’t do, and dispell a number of myths that seem to be floating around. I’ll then discuss the moral dilemmas that arise when the AI/ML system starts behaving in an “unfair” or “unethical” manner. I will not attempt to resolve these dilemmas, I will simply demonstrate that it is mathematically impossible (for humans or AIs) to do so in a manner satisfying to everyone.
