overview:
  left_content: |
    The 2018 edition will be a single track event featuring talks, discussions, and workshops. 
   
     This year, we're discussing how design can move beyond the whims of individuals and how design teams can scale in large companies. Meta Refresh 2018 will focus on the following domains
    
    * **User research and design** – How user research is carried out for products and translated into design (whether engineering or desinging user interactions).
    * **Design systems** – Case studies on how collaborations are being enabled between engineers and designers.
    * **Tooling and design systems** – Experiences and evaluations of tools for creating and maintaining design systems.
    * **UI/UX** – Why the boundaries between UI/UX are no longer relevant.

  right_content: |
    The target audience for 2018 edition includes:

    * Interaction designers.
    * Visual designers.
    * UI engineers.
    * Product managers.
    * Businesses interested in understanding how to understand users, and thereby design better user experience and design.
